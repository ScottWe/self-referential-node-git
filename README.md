# Self Referential Noe GIT
This project will commit to its own repository, provided you have access.
This requires you have an SSH key tied to your GIT account, and set to the correct remote origin corresponding to that SSH key.
That is: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git`
